It seemed to me that the direction of the craft was the only thing that mattered, so much so that if the craft was going left, it was hostile, and if it was going right, it was friendly. And during the first half of the second part of the experiment, I tried to make decisions with this in mind, but halfway through it, I started having serious doubts about my decisions. For example, if we're talking about a damaged autonomous submarine that is slowly moving left, is it moving slowly to avoid being detected, making it hostile, or because it's friendly and the crew isn't in a rush? What if the same craft is quickly moving left? Is it moving quickly to avoid my ship, making it hostile? Or because it's a friendly craft, in a rush to get to its destiny? Then what about the status of the craft? If an autonomous submarine is quickly going left, if it's damaged I can assume it's looking for help, and it's friendly. Or I can assume it's damaged because it's hostile and got attacked by our defenses. And so on and so forth.","Direction,Speed,Status,Role,Craft","1,2,3,4,5"

The slower the craft was moving the more dangerous it was whereas fast moving crafts were moving too fast in order for me to deem them to be a danger to my ship. This was still the case whether they were decoys or autonomous. Slower moving vehicles also tended to go left more. Slower moving airplanes were always hostile. Whereas the majority of slow moving submarines were hostile. The damage of the crafts did not tend to make any sort of difference to their friendliness or hostility. ,"Speed,Craft,Direction,Status,Role","1,2,3,4,5"
212,integrated,operator,"Status,Speed,Direction,Craft,Role","3,4,1,0,2",verbal_report_textbox_phase3,The best indicator as to identifying whether a craft is friendly or hostile is the speed of the vehicle. So when the machine was faulty I had no confidence in the decisions that I was making and instead focused more on the direction the craft was going and whether it was autonomous or a decoy. If all the equipment was working well it is easy to identify the friendly crafts and the hostile ones but when the speed of the craft is not visible it's based on feelings. As when I was first judging the whether the crafts were friendly or hostile I got all my feedback from the speed they were travelling as I got that correct every time regardless of the other varied elements whereas with this one. I was so much more uncertain. ,"Speed,Direction,Craft,Status,Role","1,2,3,4,5"
